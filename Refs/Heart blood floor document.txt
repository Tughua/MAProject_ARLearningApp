Blood is moved through the heart by a series of contractions and relaxations of the cardiac muscle in the walls of the four chambers. These events form the cardiac cycle. The main stages are illustrated below.

1. Blood enters the atria. it cannot yet pass into the ventricles because the bicuspid (mitral) and tricuspid valves are closed.

2. The walls of the atria contract. This raises the pressure of blood in the atria which forces open the bicuspid and tricuspid valves. Blood passes through these valves into the ventricles.

3. When the ventricles are full, they contract. This  increases the pressure of blood in the ventricles which closes the bicuspid and tricuspid valves again. Blood cannot return to the atria.

4. The ventricels continue to contract and the pressure continues to increase. This forces open the semi-lunar valves at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Blood is ejeceted into these two arteries. The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs. The aorta has branches that carry blood to all other parts of the body.

5. As the ventricles empty higher pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery closes the valves in these blood vessels. The cycle then begins again as the atria start fo fill with blood.
