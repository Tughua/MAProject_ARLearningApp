INSTRUCTIONS:
------------
Yes, you need to attach this script to a GameObject in your scene. The targetObject variable in the script is the GameObject that you want to hide and unhide. Here's what you should do:

- Create an Empty GameObject:

In your Unity scene, right-click in the Hierarchy window.
Choose "Create Empty" to create an empty GameObject.

- Attach the Script:

Select the newly created empty GameObject in the Hierarchy.
Drag and drop the script onto the Inspector window, or use the "Add Component" button to add the script.

- Assign the Target Object:

In the Inspector, you'll see a field named targetObject in the script component.
Drag the GameObject that you want to hide and unhide into this field.

- Testing:

Run your Unity scene.
Double-tap on the screen while the app is running to see if it hides and unhides the specified object.
Make sure to save your scene and project after making these changes.
