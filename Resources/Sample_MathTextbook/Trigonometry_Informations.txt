Sine, Cosine and Tangent

Right Triangle
Sine, Cosine and Tangent are the main functions used in Trigonometry and are based on a Right-Angled Triangle.

Before getting stuck into the functions, it helps to give a name to each side of a right triangle:

Sine, Cosine and Tangent
Sine, Cosine and Tangent (often shortened to sin, cos and tan) are each a ratio of sides of a right angled triangle:

Size Does Not Matter
The triangle can be large or small and the ratio of sides stays the same.

Only the angle changes the ratio.

How to remember? Think "Sohcahtoa"!

It works like this:

Soh...
Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse
...cah...
Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse
...toa
Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent

Why?
Why are these functions important?

Because they let us work out angles when we know sides
And they let us work out sides when we know angles
